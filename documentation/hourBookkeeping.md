#Hour bookkeeping

*Note that an hour contains about 5 to 10 minutes of breaks in average*

*Time format is dd/mm/yyyy*


**Wednesday 2/9/2015, 1 hour**

Started the project: 
- made the repository
- made the project in Netbeans
- started the basic documentation of the project

**Monday 7/9/2015, 5 hours**

- thought about some of the basic functionality more thoroughly
- started actually coding
  - added a couple of domain classes (Seat and Hall)
  - added a couple of file handling classes (HallAdder and HallParser)
  - created javadoc comments for them at the same time
  - created tests for the domain classes and tested them thoroughly

**Tuesday 8/9/2015, 4 hours**

- wrote tests for the HallAdder and HallParser classes
(noteworthy that this took some time as there was some stuff with the files that was a little hard to test and I couldn't get some things to work properly)
