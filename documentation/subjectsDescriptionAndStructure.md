#Movie theater seat service

**Subject:**
The software offers a seat service for a movie theater. The employee of the movie theater chooses which hall (depending on the movie the customer wants to see) is shown to the customer.

All the seats in a given hall of the theater are shown to customers. The customers can then choose which available seats they take. When a customer chooses a seat, it will be marked as unavailable and can't be chosen anymore by other customers.

Employee can add more halls to the database (which is just a text file at least for now) of the theater.

**Users:**
Movie theater's employee(s) and customers

**The operations of employee:**
- picks the hall (where the movie that the customer wants to see is)
- adds more halls to the database if needed

**The operations of customers:**
- chooses and picks a seat
	- the seat has to be marked as available to succeed


*note:*
At the moment the idea is that the employee will have other software to know in which hall each movie is shown, but it's very possible or even likely that some kind of functionality for it will be added to this project at some point
